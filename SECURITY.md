## Report a Vulnerability

If you suspect or confirm a possible vulnerability, let us know privately by DM. You can find us on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/gF36AT3). Due to the limited time, it is possible that the issue will not be answered or fixed, if so, it is because the team considers that it is not of vital importance. It will still be taken into consideration.

In your report, please include as much detail as possible:

- The version or git sha of FlameCord you are running.
- Your operating system distribution & version.
- Steps to reproduce.
- Expected behavior.
- Obtained behavior.
