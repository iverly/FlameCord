## Feactures
* Our features are focused on the security of your Minecraft server preventing hacking with crash exploits, bots and other kind of dos attacks on the application layer.

* **Bots**: We provides a powerful anti-bot solution programmed directly into the core of BungeeCord, with the ability to mitigate these attacks without hindering your server's performance.

* **Anti-vpn/proxy**: Checks whether a connection is a proxy/VPN by utilizing web databases from over 10 webs, and additional websites can be added as well.

* **Performance**: It reduces CPU usage and RAM usage by optimizing and reusing code, caching heavy getters, using libdeflate for faster compression/decompression of packets, and fixing memory leaks.

* **GeyserMC compatibility**: MangoCord supports Geyser, a proxy that allows Bedrock Edition players to join Java Edition servers. It supports most Java features and cross-play between different platforms.

* **Motd**: Incorporates customizable an advanced motd system that protects against null pink attacks

* **Languages Supported**: Provides you with absolute flexibility by allowing you to fully customize all messages and texts of your server through the messages.yml configuration file.

* **Exploit Fixes**: MangoCord specializes in providing better server security by fixing major exploits, performance flaws and bugs that Bungeecord already has, and that have not yet been fixed in WaterfallMC.

MangoCord  will track upstream Waterfall and merge changes as needed.
